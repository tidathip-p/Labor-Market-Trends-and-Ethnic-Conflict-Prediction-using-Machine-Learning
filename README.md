# 📘 Predicting Ethnic Conflict in Asia using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Overview
This research is a self-initiated project conducted under the guidance of a research fellow (PhD) within the Big Data team at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). It explores the relationship between labor market trends and the risk of ethnic conflict in Asia. Using data from 1990 to 2022, the goal is to build a machine learning model that identifies key predictors of ethnic unrest and generates predictive insights.
